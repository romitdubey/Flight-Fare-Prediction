# Flight Fare Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains a flight fare prediction model that uses machine learning techniques to estimate the fares for airline flights. The goal of this project is to provide users with a reliable tool to estimate the cost of air travel, helping them make informed decisions when planning their trips.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: The model utilizes a comprehensive dataset of historical flight fares, including various parameters such as departure and arrival locations, flight duration, airline, time of booking, and more.

- **Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. This ensures that the input data is in a suitable format for the machine learning algorithms.

- **Model Selection**: Different regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are implemented and compared to determine the most accurate and efficient model for flight fare prediction.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The selected machine learning model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize performance.

- **Web Interface (Optional)**: If integrated into a web application, users can input flight details through a user-friendly interface and receive an estimated fare prediction in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the data preprocessing and model training notebooks)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (for data analysis, preprocessing, and model building)
- Flask (for creating a web interface, if applicable)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/romitdubey/Flight-Fare-Prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd flight-fair-prediction`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the data preprocessing notebook to clean and transform the dataset.
5. Run the model training notebook to build and evaluate different regression models.
6. *(Optional)* Integrate the trained model into a web application using Flask or any other web framework.

## Disclaimer

The flight fare predictions provided by this model are based on historical data and machine learning algorithms. Actual flight prices may vary due to factors not accounted for in the model, such as sudden market changes, promotions, and other external influences. Users are advised to use the predictions as estimates and to check with airlines or travel agencies for the most accurate and up-to-date fare information.
